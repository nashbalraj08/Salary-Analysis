             * Ratings are positively skewed, with a majority of ratings clustering between 3.5 and 4.5
             * There are fewer ratings below 2.5, indicating most companies are rated relatively high
             * Slight Left Skew: The slight left skew in the distribution indicates that there are 
             some lower outliers, a few companies have ratings below 1, which are potential outliers or reflect poorly-rated companies
